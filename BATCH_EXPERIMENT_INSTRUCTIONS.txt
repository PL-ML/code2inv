To run the batch experiments with slurm, run `./run_exp.sh $exp_type -o output_directory`. This needs a machine running slurm.

If slurm is not available, run the experiments with `./run_exp_noslurm.sh $exp_type $timelimit -o output_directory`. However, this runs one instance at a time so the experiments will take significantly longer to complete. $timelimit indicates the time limit for each benchmark evaluation (each experiment has multiple benchmarks) and takes the time in the same format as the bash timeout command.

The following exp_types are available:
`c` for the 133 linear C benchmarks
`c_nl` for the 7 non linear C benchmarks
`chc` for the 120 linear CHC benchmarks
`chc_nl` for the 8 non linear CHC benchmarks
`learning` for training the weights for the transferbility experiment
`fine_tuning` for evaluating invariants using the trained weights from the learning experiment
`fine_tuning_untrained` for evaluating invariants without pretrained weights

Examples:
`./run_exp_noslurm.sh c 12h` # to run the experiments on the 133 linear C benchmarks with a 12 hour timelimit for each benchmark
