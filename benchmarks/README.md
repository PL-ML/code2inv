# Directory Structure
- The directory `C_instances` consists of 133 C programs, their program graphs and their verification conditions we collected to evaluate Code2Inv.

- The directory `CHC_instances` consists of 120 CHC constraints and their corresponding program graphs we collected to evaluate Code2Inv.

- The directory `nl-bench` consists of the non linear programs used to evaluate Code2Inv.

- The directory `pre-train-study` consists of generated (i.e. inserting confounding variables/statements) C programs and corresponding graphs and VCs.
