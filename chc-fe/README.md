# Using chc-fe

chc-fe has only been tested with the CHC instances in the benchmarks and other similar instances generated by Seahorn

Run the following to generate the graph for `chc_file`:
```
$ python graph-gen.py ${chc_file}
```

For example:
```
$ python graph-gen.py ../benchmarks/CHC_instances/sygus-constraints/sygus-bench-101.c.smt
```
