# Testing the VC Generation

1. Make sure the following directories exist- `results` `tmp` and `tmp-test`
    * If they don't, create them using `mkdir -p results tmp tmp-test`
2. You should now be able to run `test.sh`
    * `$ test.sh <number>`
    * The number denotes the line number in the `/path/to/code2inv/benchmarks/namelist.txt` file, which denotes the file to be tested.
    * `test.sh` checks if the generated invariant is satisfied with Z3 with the VC generated by clang-fe
3. To run a batch of programs using `qsub`, execute `$ ./run.py <benchmarks> <log file>`.
    * Within the cluster.sub file, set the time limit and also make sure that the appropriate python environment is selected and add the command to cd to this tests directory.
    * The benchmarks file must be a txt file with a list of numbers similar to the `/path/to/code2inv/benchmarks/namelist.txt` file.
    * `numlist.txt` is an example of such a benchmarks file.
    * All numbers must be between 0 and 132, both inclusive.
